# API Configuration for Development
# In development, the API runs on localhost:8000
# In production, this is automatically set to /api/v1 (relative URL) via .env.production
#
# For local development, use:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
#
# Note: Do NOT set REACT_APP_API_URL in production - it's already configured in .env.production
